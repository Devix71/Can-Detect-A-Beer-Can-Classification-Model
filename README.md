# Can-Detect-A-Beer-Can-Classification-Model

## Quickstart Guide for Running The Model

### Dataset Download

- **Dataset**: The raw image dataset and the cropped dataset used by the model can be found on [Mega.nz](https://mega.nz/folder/AHRCjbxY#ZVpEQZ3a7fIXuhoVl0xoTA).
- **Required File**: Download and unarchive `Beer_Images_Cropped.zip`. Ensure the resulting `Beer_Images_Cropped` folder is in the same directory as the notebooks.

### Running the Model

The model is designed to be user-friendly with minimal configurations:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - For brew type classification: Run `Multiclass_BrewType_Classification.ipynb`.
   - For taste labelling: Run `Multilabel_Taste_Classification.ipynb`.

### Additional Information

- `beer_glossary.csv`: Contains information from the raw dataset, including bounding boxes, beer can details, and image filenames from `Beer_Images.zip`.
- `UQ_Beer_Repo.xlsx`: Provides an overview of each unique beer product in the dataset.
